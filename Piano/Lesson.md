We have built a Piano using
a little bit of everything we have learnt so far
we even have used the float property

we used overflow hidden , on the original class so when use the media querry the elements won't overlap

we used @media

but i'll need more explanation or tutorial to fully grasp it

again same with the CSS positioning and Pseudo selector ::before and ::after
