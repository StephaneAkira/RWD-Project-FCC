Aight

we have learned about tabes , but to be hones i need another tutorial to catch on really , it was fast and i didn't really understand much

- we have learnt about few CSS functions and pseudo selector such as

* :last-of-type
* :first-of-type
* :nth-of-type()
* selector[class="class_name"]
* span[class~="sr-only"]

we have talked a little bit about the CSS positionning or position
but more on this on the next Project i guess

- we have talked about the Calc function, but i'll need a tutorial as well for better understanding
