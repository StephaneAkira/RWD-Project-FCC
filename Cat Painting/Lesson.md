We have just completed he project

during the project we have learnt a lot about

CSS Positioning
a little bit of CSS transform with the rotate property that uses deg

and some extended version of border radius and note that border-radius helps in shaping things into a circular shape

- i'll need to revisit CSS Positioning and CSS transform since most of the other things were simple to understand

- we also saw z-index for the first time , i'l need tutorials about it as well
