Aight the Lesson is done

we have learned quite a bit about the box model

the box model is a concept that helps us see html elements as containers

each element is a container
and as a container it has 4 important parts

# content :

whatever that is inside the container
the main or key thing of the container

# Padding:

the space surrounding the content
the space when we use a background color we will see it ,
it's the space between the content and the border

# Border:

border is the border it helps us separate the padding and the margin
it has its own shorthand that we will discuss in a bit

# Then We have the Margin

margin is the space between to element
the higher value of margin between containers will take precedence

margin helps separating elements

# Padding , Margin

They have the same kind of shorthand property

# top, bottom , left , right

# if we use 2 values it becomes

top and bottom , left-right

# if we use 3 values it becomes

top , left and rigt , bottom

# Note:

to center content on an element
we can just type padding: auto
to center horizontally we can just set left and right to auto, to center vertically we can just set top and bottom to auto

to center an element we can just set margin: auto,

everything is the same as with padding

we have also seen overflow : hidden
more on this on fuure lessons i guess

but it helps to keep the margins in check so it don't overflow the container

we've also seen Transform: rotate
to rotate elements
to go clockwise use positive numbers,
to go counter-clockwise use negative

with deg as the thing

we've also used the filter property
with a blur (value) , it takes px

this helps blur an element

so far we have enough knwoledge to understand the box model and manipulate is as we wish

we've also seen border-radius and its shorthand propery
border-radius : helps us to round elements by either using px or % those are ones we have used so far

its shorthand goes like this :
top-left , top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left
